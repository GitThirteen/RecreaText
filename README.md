An application segmenting long objects out of an image and creating a new one through the power of magic and tears. We might use Matlab as well, not sure.

## Requirements
The program requires two images: one showing objects that should be rearranged to display a text, the other one showing the text to be recreated.
For example images see the assets folder.

## How to run the program

1. Run Recreatext.mlapp
2. You will see a GUI
3. Click "Objekte auswaehlen" to load an image showing the objects that should recreate the Text. You can use the images in the assets folder. 
3. Click "Text auswaehlen" to load an image showing the Text you want to recreate. You can use the images in the assets folder. 
4. Click "GO" to run the program
